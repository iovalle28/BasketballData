## Introduction

Our approach was to put ourselves in the shoes of a management team that is assigned to put together the best NBA team possible. Our team put together a set of fundamental business questions that will help us determine where the team can save in costs as well as where to look for talent. We believe that our managerial approach is significally a better and more scientific approach rather than blindly trying to put together a team. 

## Business Questions
1. Is there a relationship between a player’s salary and player’s performance?
    * Do the same players with the highest PRA (points, rebounds & assists) make the most money?

*This business question helps our team determine budgeting costs. What is the most optimal salary to pay? Does a big salary improve performance?*

2. How significant is the the first draft pick?
    *If you are a basketball team manager, is it worth it to spend extra money or trade players to be a first round pick?

3. What is the optimal geolocation to start a basketball team? What region has the best performing players?
    *Is there a specific birthplace that produces better basketball players?
    *Is there a specific college that produces better basketball players?
