## 1. Introduction

Our approach was to put ourselves in the shoes of a management team that is assigned to put together the best NBA team possible. Our team put together a set of fundamental business questions that will help us determine where the team can save in costs as well as where to look for talent. We believe that our managerial approach is significally a better and more scientific approach rather than blindly trying to put together a team. 

## 2. Business Questions
1. Is there a relationship between a player’s salary and player’s performance?
    * Which players are undervalued or overvalued?
    * How much should we pay a player based on their performance?

*(This business question helps our team determine budgeting costs. What is the most optimal salary to pay? Does a big salary improve performance?)*

2. How significant is the the first draft pick?
    *If you are a basketball team manager, is it worth it to spend extra money or trade players to be a first round pick?

*(This is another budget question that will help managers of teams see how important salaries are to performance.)*

3. What is the optimal geolocation to start a basketball team? What region has the best performing players?
    *Is there a specific birthplace that produces better basketball players?
    *Is there a specific college that produces better basketball players?
    
*(This final business question is to determine where to target the draft picks from)*

## 3. Data Cleanse/ Munging/ Preparation    

Our team used a free data set from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball. Which had an enormous amount of data from basketball games to player statistics. The database was in sqllite format given by kaggle so our team had to use an sql query via Jupyter notebooks in order to pull only the data that we needed. Each business question had its own dataset taken from the database. We extracted the dataset via sql and exported into csv format. From there, we would upload the csv into R to do our data cleansing. 

Exibit 3.1) *This query was used to pull just the "player attributes" dataset from the database.*

![sample query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208268033-eca28f39-73bd-479b-964b-f5bf904e9c83.png)

### Data preparation for business question 1: Salary vs. Player Performance

In our data set the salary for players and the performance were located in two different tables.  The salary was listed for each contract, which meant in the salary table each player had multiple rows.  The first step to getting the data set ready was to group the contracts by the players name and get both the sum and average contract for each player in the salary table.

 ![Picture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272688-3c842eec-723e-4c28-99b3-5d354dda0c40.png)

After getting the salary dataset grouped by player with both sum and average contract, we could combine in with the table containing player performance statistics.
![Picture10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272762-04d0b7ee-fe60-43ea-8ae9-dbb6d63049fa.png)


After merging the datasets we were left with 415 players that had both player performance statistics as well as salary data.  We then added the statistics Points, Rebounds, and Assists into one variable called PRA.
![Picture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272691-31bc6d90-c9ee-47a0-84a4-4cc79ebc0bc4.png)

### Data preparation for business question 2: First Draft Pick

* After the csv was read using read_csv(), we inspected the columns available to us and created a dataframe with the only columns we needed:

df <- select(player_attributes_df,ID,FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME,TEAM_NAME,SCHOOL,COUNTRY,POSITION,DRAFT_YEAR,DRAFT_NUMBER,PTS,AST,REB,ALL_STAR_APPEARANCES)

* Next, we removed rows that show NA in the columns we selected in df.

na.omit(df$DRAFT_NUMBER)

* For points, assists and rebounds, we turned all NA's to zeros. We also did the same for All Star Appearances - the logic being, there was most likely no All Star Appreance if there is an NA.

df <- df %>% mutate(PTS = ifelse(is.na(PTS), 0, PTS))
df <- df %>% mutate(AST = ifelse(is.na(AST), 0, AST))
df <- df %>% mutate(REB = ifelse(is.na(REB), 0, REB))
df <- df %>% mutate(ALL_STAR_APPEARANCES = ifelse(is.na(ALL_STAR_APPEARANCES), 0, ALL_STAR_APPEARANCES))

* Some columns also had values other than NA that needed to be removed too. Values that say "none" or "undrafted" were removed since those players did not end up getting drafted.

df <-subset(df, DRAFT_NUMBER!="None" & DRAFT_NUMBER!="Undrafted")

* We noticed that some columns needed to be numeric values such as draft number and draft year. So we made those changes: 

df$DRAFT_NUMBER <- as.numeric(df$DRAFT_NUMBER)
df$DRAFT_YEAR <- as.numeric(df$DRAFT_YEAR)

* Now, some additional columns needed to be created. We wanted to create a binary column that either shows if someone had an All Star Appearance or not. The logic being that some players had many All Star Appearances and we did not want to scew the data too much. 

df$ALL_STAR <- ifelse(df$ALL_STAR_APPEARANCES>=1,"YES","NO")

* Finally, the last column we created was a way to combine all the possible points a player can earn into one number. We did this simply by adding all the points a player can earn by points, assits and rebounds. 

TOTAL_POINTS <- df$PTS+df$AST+df$REB
TOTAL_POINTS
df$TOTAL_POINTS <- c(TOTAL_POINTS)

### Data preparation for business question 3: Optimal Geolocation

## 4. Descriptive Statistics & Visualizations

### Statistics & Visualizations for Business Question 1: Salary vs. Player Performance


### Scatter Plots
This scatter plot compares total production (Points + Rebounds + Assists) with career earnings of each player in the dataset.  There is a large grouping of players with very low career earnings which is likely due to a large proportion of players only receiving one or two contracts in their careers as well as younger players that are still on of their first contracts even if that contract is large their career earnings are smaller compared to more experienced players.  

![Picture3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272695-3a6d3d17-69bc-4c48-9996-57d03107c972.png)


This scatter plot compares total production with average contract (not average per year as the data set did not provide lengths on contracts).  When comparing performance with average salary rather than total salary, the data is spread more evenly and appears to have a stronger linear relationship.

![Picture4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272697-567af282-91dd-48b5-9347-f90ac00dbe44.png)

### Column Charts
This column chart compares years of experience with total career earnings for each player in the dataset.

![Picture5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272772-b18f26bd-4ee4-4fe6-b511-ae9448069b8c.png)

This column chart compares years of experience with average career earnings for each player in the dataset.

![Picture6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272776-97f92661-9b2f-4339-9895-cf97e974f7c8.png)

This column chart compares our performance statistic PRA with total years of expereince for each player in the dataset.

![Picture7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272778-252fd06a-d3b3-4e0c-b231-9978575384f9.png)

From these datasets we can see that actually players with a medium level of experience (3-8) years seem to have the largest salaries both total and average contract and players with the most experience have the lowest total and average salaries.  Based on the chart showing performance and experience younger players in this dataset have much higher production than older players.  We would have suspected that more older players would have higher total career earnings but since our data set only has salary information for 415 players out of the 4500 total players in the set, it Is likely that these observations are not reflective of the whole.


### Statistics & Visualizations for Business Question 2: First Draft Pick

After the data was cleaned for business question 2, we decided to run some ggplots to get a better understanding. 

* First Draft Pick vs. All Star Appearance Scatter Plot:
![Draft pick vs  All star appearance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208358179-88208cbe-58ea-42bb-8f69-34fdbb5c42a8.png)

*We can see visually that there does not seem to be much difference in being a draft pick vs. having all star appearances*

* First Draft Pick vs. Total Points

![Total Points vs Draft Number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208358418-4e1963fe-bb88-4266-bacf-bfa6561616d7.png)

*The data here looks a bit scattered but in the next exhibit, we will see how the data looks around a line of best fit.*


* How dispearsed is the data around a line of best fit?

![Total Points vs Draft Number with LM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208358432-74de105e-38ec-45b4-a261-aa2f5df9a886.png)

*As suspected, the line of best fit does not look good here with data dispearsed all over.*

### Statistics & Visualizations for Business Question 3: Optimal Geolocation
### Bar Chart
Here we take a look at which schools were the best at developing NBA caliber players.
![Top schools for amount of NBA players produced bar chart ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119911893/208447962-8df97f6c-64c9-4f5d-b37e-2656fbce77ff.png)
### Visualizing it with maps
By creating functions within R that takes the school name and location from the streetmaps.org website with the vector I created to be able to return Latitudes and longitudes of each school that I put inside the argument or parameter of the function and adding those coordinates to our dataframe to visualize the location with maps.

![Top schools by total amount of NBA players produced map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119911893/208447651-841a5594-0aea-47f0-a6eb-60724b54b6f0.png)
Here we further filter schools by amount of players that had at least one all star appearance
![Top schools by total amount of All stars bar chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119911893/208449763-08cd840d-2e00-406f-a97b-f2a880974aa3.png)
Mapping those results you can see that not suprisingly most of the schools who developed the most amount of NBA players also developed the most all stars
![Top schools by historical amount of all star players map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119911893/208446975-6623fed0-6a78-4c09-a6d2-36adc07b50d0.png)
### Bar Chart for International countries based by players performance
 On this bar chart we take a look at which international countries were the most successful at developing players into the NBA based on the formula
 (PTS + 2*AST + 1.5 *Reb)
![Top international countries by players perfomance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119911893/208448814-d9eff148-62b7-4323-9882-4ac11dfc3c98.png)

In conclusion you can see by the addition of maps that a great majority of the top schools in both metrics are located in the mid west region of the US. And you can see that not surprisingly the top schools include big names like UCLA, Kentucky and Duke.

## 5. Data Modeling

### Data Modeling for Business Question 1: Salary vs. Player Performance
### Linear Models
For the salary dataset we did two linear models with both total salary and average salary vs our performance statistic, PRA.  
![Picture8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272780-f04181cc-5448-4bb1-8aaf-b854566bd498.png)
![Picture9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80026659/208272782-2ba9a953-4c9d-413f-b449-29c4451d49bb.png)

 
The first linear model for total salary has an adjusted R squared value of .53 which means that approximately 53% of the variance in total salary is explained by our performance statistic.  Average salary has a higher adjusted R squared with 62% of the variance in average salary being explained by the performance statistic.

### Data Modeling for Business Question 2: First Draft Pick

Our team wanted to run two types of models on first draft picks. One of which was the linear regression approach which would be useful to find out if the amount of points a player earned had any effect due to the fact that they were a first round draft pick.

The second model was the Support Vector Machine that would be able to see if there was a way to predict whether being a first round pick had a higher chance of earning an All Star Appearance. 

* LINEAR MODEL
![LM model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208361882-4a2e3386-333e-45c5-b62f-117fa13112ea.png)

We set up our model and trained it using 70% of the data set. We then saw how well of a predictive model this was down below:


![Linear Model Outcome 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208361806-2cb68f76-64aa-49a1-ac20-c5cc21afca2f.png)

![Linear Model Outcome 1 correlation value](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208362341-37ec2d3b-2494-4dfc-997b-d771a7425265.png)

Our results show us an R squared of just .15 and a correlation from the predictive values of only .17. This shows us that there is not much correlation between being the first draft pick vs. performance.

We can use this model to answer part of our business question and see which players are over or undervalued and how much we should pay each player.  Based on the second model which is using average contract amount we get an intercept of -3,690,576 and a coeffecient of 813,696 for our peformance statistic.  We can interpret this to mean that a player needs to average at least 4.5 PRA and then each additional point rebound or assist above that is worth $813,696 of additional contract value.  

So we would expect a player that averaged 10 points, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds per game (20 PRA) to have a contract valued at $12,583,344.  To maximize the value and performance of our team we would want to sign a player with those statistics to a contract of 12 million or less.  This can also help when having to give players new contracts deciding what an equitable value is based on their performance.

* SVM MODEL

![SVM model code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208362908-bd33306f-f0be-40e2-a18c-89af2013b662.png)




Finally, the SVM model also showed similar results to the previous model. 

![SVM model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208362929-833fede4-716a-406f-b715-e89e73f96d40.png)



While the model shows to have great predictive power, the big point here is that the no information rate is as good as our model. That means that anyone's best guess would do just as good as our model. 

![SVM model confusion matrix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119478875/208362955-23cef2be-7dd9-498c-b203-5d822046c0d0.png)


## 6.Conclusions

Our team would like to first point out that we utilized a free dataset and we believe that our findings could reveal a lot more if we were able to utilize a paid dataset. However, with the free data available, we were able to pull useful insights for basketball managers or scouts. The first business question about player vs. salary shows that if considering performance to be derived from PRA points, then the majority of the talent pool lies in the average salary range. This is big because it shows that a manager does not need to pay top dollar for a top performer.

Furthermore, for business question 2, we show that a first draft pick does not necessarily correlate with great performance. This goes against all logic since typically fans and teams will rely on the draft pick process to speculate how well their team will perform. However, our data shows otherwise and we speculate that this is because managers and scouts could be attracted to players because of "fear of missing out" or focusing too much on "trending players". Whatever the case may be, it would not unreasonable to state that there is a lot of hubris in the basketball industry when it comes to managing teams.

Finally, our last business question shows exactly which schools should be targetted when recruiting players. Statistically, we see a strong correlation of which schools produce the best players. Further analysis can even be done with more data on why these schools produce the best players.
